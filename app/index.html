          <p class="card__Description">
            I love powerlifting because it challenges me both physically and
            mentally—every session pushes me to be stronger, more focused, and
            more disciplined. There’s something incredibly rewarding about
            chasing personal records and actually seeing the progress in the
            weights I can lift. But it’s not just about the numbers—the sense of
            community is powerful. Being surrounded by people who support and
            inspire each other makes the journey even more meaningful. It’s not
            just a sport to me; it’s a passion and a way of life.

          <p class="card__Description">
            I love Spotify because it’s more than just a music app—it’s my daily
            soundtrack. Whether I’m lifting at the gym, relaxing at home, or
            driving around, there’s always the perfect playlist or album ready
            to go. I can discover new artists, revisit old favorites, and create
            custom playlists that match my every mood. The personalized
            recommendations are spot-on, and it feels like Spotify just gets my
            taste in music. It’s not just how I listen—it’s how I connect with
            what I’m feeling.

          <h2 class="card__tittle">Art</h2>
          <p class="card__Description">
            I love art because it’s how I express what words can’t always say.
            Whether I’m creating or just appreciating it, art lets me connect
            with emotions, stories, and ideas on a deeper level. There’s
            something magical about turning a blank canvas into something
            meaningful, something that speaks to people in different ways. It’s
            a form of freedom—no rules, just imagination. Art inspires me, calms
            me, and challenges me. It’s not just a hobby; it’s a part of who I
            am.

          <h2 class="card__tittle">Reading</h2>
          <p class="card__Description">
            I love reading because it lets me escape into other worlds while
            still teaching me about my own. Every book is a new adventure, a new
            perspective, or a deeper understanding of something I didn’t know
            before. Whether it’s fiction that stirs my imagination or nonfiction
            that expands my thinking, reading fuels my curiosity and gives me
            time to slow down and reflect. It’s my quiet space, my inspiration,
            and my way of constantly growing. Books have this incredible power
            to stay with me long after I’ve turned the last page.
